# AIWorkHub for VS Code

AIWorkHub is a repository-native control plane for multi-model software
development. It gives every repository an isolated task system, Source Graph,
durable project context, worker runtime and evidence-first review loop.

The extension opens as a retained editor tab and runs one repository-scoped
MCP stdio runtime on the workspace host. It does not open a browser, bind a
port, expose a LAN service or require an AIWorkHub cloud account.

## What's new in 0.9.59

- MCP stdio now uses AIWorkHub's bounded parallel backend across the dashboard
  and stable Codex/Claude/Copilot registrations, keeping unrelated calls
  responsive while providers or reviewers run.
- Bare empty-parameter `-32602` episodes are rejected and recorded at the
  protocol boundary instead of leaving the shared MCP lane poisoned.

- Malformed empty-string/non-object MCP parameters are rejected before
  dispatch with a bounded redacted protocol alert.
- Valid empty-object calls and parallel healthy clients remain serviceable.
- Repository-owned sideband sockets remain portable under long retained
  workspace paths without falling back to global system temp directories.

See the packaged **Changelog** for the complete release summary.

## Highlights

- Plan and inspect dependency-aware AI tasks from one operational dashboard.
- Delegate to supported local model adapters and track real terminal outcomes.
- Replace repeated raw-source discovery with a repository Source Graph covering
  34 configurable code, data and documentation families.
- Send focused code fragments through staged semantic edits and let the local
  bridge assemble the hash-bound final envelope without model-side full-file
  regeneration.
- Use 31 bounded source-intelligence modes for symbols, calls, tests, impact,
  complexity, ownership, hotspots, gaps and task-shaped context bundles.
- Preserve continuity through Session Manager, AI Memory and KB.
- Review diffs, tests, logs, artifacts, approval history and deterministic
  Quality Evidence before acceptance.
- Run a changed-file Known Bug Scanner across C/C++/CUDA, Python,
  JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Java/Kotlin and PHP without treating heuristic
  warnings as proven failures.
- Measure whether workers used Source Graph throughout the task through
  authenticated tool-use receipts and continuous-use telemetry.
- Keep repositories isolated in separate `.aiworkhub/` authorities.
- Run on Linux, macOS, native Windows, WSL and Remote-SSH.

## Operational surface

The retained dashboard combines the task DAG, live worker output, Review
Inbox, callback health, model readiness, tool-use statistics, storage
retention, Source Graph coverage and bounded viewers for logs, sessions,
AI Memory and KB. Settings remain repository-local under `.aiworkhub/`, so a
multi-window installation does not share task or context authority between
repositories.

## Get started

1. Install from the Marketplace (or install a release VSIX) and open a Git
   repository in VS Code.
2. Run **AIWorkHub: Open Dashboard**.
3. Select the repository when using a multi-root workspace.
4. Choose **Initialize AIWorkHub** on first use.
5. Open a new Codex, Claude or MCP-capable chat after registration so the new
   runtime tools are discovered by that chat process.

Initialization is explicit and idempotent. It creates repository-local state
only under `.aiworkhub/` and starts the first Source Graph index in the
background.

For Claude Code, initialization also maintains the repository-local
`.mcp.json` server registration and the bounded AIWorkHub block in `CLAUDE.md`.
Open a **new** Claude chat after initialization or an AIWorkHub upgrade. That
direct chat is instructed to bootstrap as the manager, call manager Source
Graph before broad `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` discovery, and re-query the graph when
its implementation or validation boundary changes. AIWorkHub-launched task
processes use the separate worker tool surface.

## Run your first task

AIWorkHub is designed for a manager chat that delegates bounded work instead
of letting several models edit one checkout without coordination.

Start a new chat after initialization or upgrade and paste:

```text
Use AIWorkHub as manager for the currently bound repository. Call
aiworkhub_manager_bootstrap first; verify repository identity, manager route,
callback, Source Graph and preflight. Do not edit or launch yet. Report what is
ready and what is degraded.
```

Then describe the desired outcome normally. Ask the manager to create bounded
cards and launch only independent, dependency-ready, non-colliding cards in
parallel. The MCP server also presents this lifecycle as a mandatory contract:
creating a task leaves it `pending`; exact claim plus launch establishes
`processing`; workers stop at `review_ready`; callbacks wake the current
verified manager; and only that manager accepts or rejects verified evidence.

1. Check the dashboard header. Repository, MCP, Source Graph and callback
   state should be ready; **Preflight** explains any unavailable optional
   model adapters.
2. Tell the manager what outcome you want. The manager creates a task card
   with an exact objective, acceptance criteria, allowed writes, validation
   commands and dependencies.
3. The manager selects a ready adapter/model and launches the exact card.
   Workers receive repository-scoped Source Graph, Session, Memory and KB
   context and work in an isolated task workspace.
4. Follow **Live Output** or continue other work. Terminal outcomes are durable
   and the originating manager receives a callback when review is required.
5. Open the task in **Review**. Inspect the bounded diff, tests, logs,
   artifacts, tool-use receipts and independent reviewer evidence.
6. **Accept** promotes the verified change and finalizes the task. **Reject**
   records exact feedback and creates a bounded residual rather than silently
   discarding the previous evidence.

Dependency cards remain pending until their prerequisites finish. Collision
checks prevent two active workers from owning overlapping write paths.

See the [complete first-run and manager manual](https://github.com/shrec/AIWorkHub/blob/main/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)
for copy/paste planning/review prompts, Remote-SSH behavior and recovery after
an interrupted write acknowledgement.

## Models and authentication

AIWorkHub does not proxy credentials or require an AIWorkHub account. It uses
models already authenticated in the corresponding editor or CLI.

| Runner | Typical adapter | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Codex CLI or VS Code Language Model | Existing Codex login or one-time VS Code consent |
| Claude | Claude Code CLI or VS Code Language Model | Existing Claude subscription login or one-time VS Code consent |
| DeepSeek V4 Pro/Flash | VS Code Language Model or Copilot CLI fallback | Provider visible in VS Code; fallback uses its own stored credential |
| GLM 5.2 | VS Code Language Model or Copilot CLI fallback | Provider visible in VS Code; fallback uses its own stored credential |
| Copilot-hosted models | VS Code Language Model | GitHub sign-in and one-time model consent |

The **Preflight** and **Workforce** views report observed availability,
adapter/model identity, outcomes, latency, token evidence and known cost. An
optional adapter being unavailable does not block otherwise ready models.

## Source Graph and context

Source Graph is an incrementally refreshed structural repository index, not a
remote Sourcegraph service. Managers and workers start with low-token `focus`
and `slice` queries, then use calls, trace, impact, test mapping or typed
bundles only when the task needs them. Operations telemetry shows which modes
were requested and executed, returned evidence, workflow stage, latency,
generation and inter-call gaps.

Session Manager stores current state and handoffs; AI Memory stores durable
lessons; KB stores curated project facts; the optional Manager Context Graph
preserves bounded manager transcript evidence. All are repository-local and
have bounded viewers in the dashboard.

## Commands

- **AIWorkHub: Open Dashboard** — open or reveal the retained editor tab.
- **AIWorkHub: Select Repository** — bind the dashboard in a multi-root window.
- **AIWorkHub: Refresh Dashboard** — refresh the current repository snapshot.
- **AIWorkHub: Restart MCP Connection** — replace only AIWorkHub's selected
  repository MCP child.

## Remote development

AIWorkHub is a workspace extension. In Remote-SSH, install it on the remote
extension host; its packaged Python runtime, MCP child and repository state run
beside the remote checkout. No port forwarding is required.

## If the dashboard is not ready

- **Connecting:** use **AIWorkHub: Restart MCP Connection** once and inspect
  the dashboard's last-log row. The extension restarts only its own child.
- **A model is unavailable:** open Preflight, confirm the provider is installed
  and grant the one-time VS Code model consent when prompted.
- **Source Graph is empty:** initialize the repository, enable the required
  language family in Settings and run a refresh.
- **A chat cannot see tools:** open a new chat after installation or upgrade so
  that client performs MCP discovery against the current runtime.
- **Windows upgraded from an old build:** activation automatically migrates
  legacy source/version `PYTHONPATH` registrations to a host-stable packaged
  runtime; no manual `config.toml` edit is required.

## Trust and privacy

- Local stdio transport; no AIWorkHub network listener.
- Read-only and launch-disabled by default.
- Repository-specific state, route identity and audit trail.
- No AIWorkHub telemetry upload of prompts, source, credentials or memories.
- Explicit manager authority for context writes and task acceptance.
