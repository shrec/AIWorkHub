# Changelog

All notable changes to AIWorkHub are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this project has
noted by package/extension version and release tag.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- `Initialize AIWorkHub` now idempotently installs the canonical AGENTS,
  Claude and Copilot tool-use projections in every initialized repository.
- Repository initialization safely merges Claude project settings with native
  denies for raw discovery tools while preserving owner settings and failing
  closed on malformed JSON.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Exposed the canonical Source Graph, Session Manager, AI Memory and KB as
  role-bound manager MCP tools as well as isolated worker MCP tools.
- Added provider-native raw-discovery denies for Claude and Copilot workers;
  `Grep`/`Glob` and shell `grep`/`rg`/`find`/`tree` cannot replace Source Graph.
- Extended the authenticated completion gate to require Session Manager and
  every requested Memory/KB surface in addition to a fresh non-empty Source
  Graph lookup for code tasks.

### Changed

- Generated agent instructions are role-aware and permit raw discovery only
  through a new exact coordinator-authorized fallback card after Source Graph
  reports a target unsupported or unindexed.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Persist manager-derived `origin_thread_id` in both the canonical task row
  and immutable card JSON so review transitions enqueue callbacks reliably.
- Preserve card origin identity when reading older rows whose denormalized
  origin column is empty.
- Make concurrent callback schema upgrades tolerate only a verified
  duplicate-column winner, preventing reload-time dispatcher thread loss.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Accept RFC 9562 UUIDv7/v8 manager session identities so current Codex
  origin threads survive mux ownership validation and `aiworkhub_task_create`
  can bind callbacks to the real originating chat.
- Treat `AIWORKHUB_REPO` as the manager-mux equivalent of the VS Code
  dashboard child's `AIWORKHUB_REPO_ROOT`, preventing false degraded health
  when both surfaces address the same canonical repository.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Made the injected AIWorkHub worker MCP the explicit mandatory interface in
  generated AGENTS, Claude and Copilot instructions; legacy `AITools` scripts,
  databases and raw repository discovery are no longer valid worker fallbacks.
- Added one-time, non-destructive migration of explicitly registered legacy
  Source Graph, Session Manager, AI Memory and KB SQLite stores into each
  repository's canonical `.aiworkhub` storage and activated their authority.
- Added manager bootstrap/task-create MCP operations and verified independent
  Codex and Claude callback lanes with repository-scoped coordinator identity.
- Hardened callback SQLite startup against transient locks and garbage-collected
  stale App Server mux runtime descriptors without touching live sessions.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Route VS Code Codex callbacks through the extension-owned App Server
  sideband mux, bundle its executable launcher in the VSIX, repair stale
  launcher settings, and start the dispatcher at VS Code startup.
- Load the current owner-only coordinator token into the MCP child instead
  of inheriting a stale parent token.
- Increment and persist `claim_epoch` on every native exact claim and
  auto-pickup so callback deduplication distinguishes requeued task episodes.
- Interrupt active sideband reads during dispatcher shutdown so VS Code
  reload cannot strand a callback batch behind a long orphaned lease.
- Discard out-of-order dashboard snapshot responses so an older overlapping
  refresh can never overwrite a newer canonical queue state.
- Treat dispatcher startup from headless worker MCP processes as a normal
  worker-role boundary; only the VS Code extension child owns coordinator
  callback dispatch and its required window identity.
- Recognize a same-repository interactive Claude Code VS Code parent as the
  selected Claude manager, derive its live window/session identity from
  same-uid runtime metadata, and grant coordinator transitions only while
  the repository route explicitly selects Claude.
- Partition callback outbox/batches by the task's originating coordinator
  provider so Codex and Claude managers operate automatically and in
  parallel without a repository-global provider toggle.
- Replace the misleading dashboard coordinator toggle with an automatic
  per-task routing status indicator.
- Native `mark_review` now durably enqueues the repository-bound callback in
  the same canonical task database.
- Callback eligibility now treats live lifecycle columns as authoritative
  over stale task-card snapshot fields, preventing genuine review events
  from being incorrectly superseded.
- Exact claim-start repairs empty denormalized runner/topic columns from the
  immutable task-card identity, preserving migrated queue compatibility.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- Removed the runtime dependency on a repository-local `AITools/taskctl.py`:
  the packaged MCP runtime now dispatches task operations directly against
  the selected repository's `.aiworkhub/tasking/task_queue.sqlite` store.
- Added native task verification, review-queue, lifecycle, export, collision,
  callback-outbox, and usage-report compatibility operations.
- Made the VSIX self-contained for initialized repositories and aligned the
  Python package, MCP runtime, and VS Code extension versions at `0.6.1`.
- Added regression coverage proving the installed runtime works without an
  `AITools/` directory or a subprocess call to the legacy task controller.

## [0.6.0] - Unreleased (public release closure)

### Changed

- Removed the manual Model capabilities / GLM canary diagnostics surface
  from the dashboard editor tab (no `vscode.lm.selectChatModels` discovery
  action, no credit-consuming canary prompt) and its obsolete extension-only
  and Python static tests; the real autonomous worker adapters, model
  routing, task launch, and callback behavior are unaffected.
- Python package (`aiworkhub`, `pyproject.toml`) and VS Code extension
  (`vscode-extension/package.json`) versions aligned at `0.6.0`, including
  the extension's own `EXPECTED_MCP_PACKAGE_VERSION` runtime-compatibility
  check.
- README rewritten to open with what AIWorkHub is and a five-minute
  VS Code install/Init Repo/use quickstart, reflecting the current
  repository-local `.aiworkhub/` canonical task-store authority instead of
  the historical `AITools/taskctl.py` / `bitnnv2/data/tasking/*` parent-repo
  wrapper design.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` added.
- `.gitignore` extended to exclude `node_modules/`, `*.vsix`, `*.sqlite`,
  `*.sqlite3`, `*.db`, and repository-local `.aiworkhub/` state.
- `SECURITY.md` and `vscode-extension/package.json` GitHub URLs corrected to
  this repository's actual current remote (`shrec/AIWorkHub`); the
  product/package/CLI identity itself stays canonical `AIWorkHub`/`aiworkhub`.

### Notes

Earlier phases (local stdio MVP, safe local automation, agent launcher,
project-switch readiness, the Task MCP -> Codex callback bridge, VS
Code-owned App Server mux/sideband transport, and the canonical
`aiworkhub` naming cutover) are tracked in detail in `MVP_ROADMAP.md`
rather than duplicated here.
